# Assignment 4 -- Recursive Descent Parser

*due on 6 June 2018*

## Task 1

- Implement a handwritten recursive descent parser (+ lexer).

Your handwritten lexer and parser should directly replace the current lexer and parser, generated by `flex` / `bison`.
Ideally you should not have to touch any other part of the code-base than the parser.
The parser interface should stay exactly the same (`parser.h`).

## Task 2

Do not discard the *old* parser from your code-base.
Add a switch to your build system (generator) which allows one to switch between the generated and handwritten parser at compile time.

## Task 3

- Enable your compiler to take multiple source files as input.

Each source file is parsed independently and the results are combined.
You should not have to modify the remaining pipeline of the compiler.
Although, you might want to add the filename to your source location information.
